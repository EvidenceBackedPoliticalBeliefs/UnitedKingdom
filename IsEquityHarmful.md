# Is Equity Harmful to Society?
Equity is a term often conflated with equality, but importantly distinct. Equity has been interpreted to mean equality of outcomes over equality of opportunities. This is a somewhat reasonable sounding premise, but the core concept, and implementation leads much to be desired. As I hope to show in this article.

As always please read the [Bias Busting](https://evidencebasedpolitics.org/FlawedThinking/BiasBusting.html) guide if you have not already done so.

# Definitions
It will be beneficial to explicitly define what I am referring to in the arguments.

## Harm
<a href="Argumentation.md#-implicit-assumptions" class="tag tag-implicit"></a>

Harm is defined according to the [framework](https://evidencebasedpolitics.org/README.html) (harm based consequentialism).

## Merit

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

An individual's total value to society in the form of their skills, achievements, effort, labour. 

No characteristic of their involuntary identity is considered in merit (e.g. race, sex, etc). 

No knowledge of their personal history is required beyond their past achievements and labours (no disabilities, no past discrimination etc).

## Equality

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/argumentation-tags.css">

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

For this argument I will take this general definition of equality taken from [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/equality-human-rights)

> Generally, an ideal of uniformity in treatment or status by those in a position to affect either.

The end goal of equality would be equal opportunity for all. Essentially no biases to involuntary or immutable states would affect someone's life. That may include Race, Sex, Sexuality, Appearance, Height, Weight, Age.

Essentially allowing a person's merit and ability be the sole determinant of their success.

Defined as a function `Deserved success = Merit`.

## Equity

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

I will define equity by the top definition returned by [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=equity) (Oxford Languages)

> The quality of being fair and just, especially in a way that takes account of and seeks to address existing inequalities.

Equity is the pursuit of balancing outcomes by taking into consideration a person's personal circumstances and history and adjusting outcomes accordingly.

Defined as a function `Deserved success = Merit + Disadvantages cost`

## Equality vs Equity

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

The difference between equity and equality is often presented with the simplistic example of a ladder. 

- There are 3 people
- Two of the people are of an average height
- One is 50% shorter than average due to a genetic defect.

| Height | Equality | Equity |
|-|-|-|
| 🧍Average| 🪜 | 🪜|
| 🧍🏽Average | 🪜 | 🪜|
| 🧍 Short | 🪜| 🪜🪜|

Equality states that everyone is treated fairly and equally by being issued the same ladder.

Equity states that the outcome is unfair because the shorter person was disadvantaged at birth. The shorter person is given a longer (more expensive) ladder to balance the outcomes.

## Implicit arguments
Equity has several implicit premises.

1. Equal outcomes are more morally positive than unequal outcomes
2. Equal outcomes will improve society as a whole.
3. Merit is not a valid metric in society without considering individual disadvantages

# Argument
I will argue:

- The pursuit of equity is harmful to society
- Equity policies can never be moral, even on an individual basis

# Is merit objective?
Merit consists of the outputs of a human being's existence. If a person makes a great piece of art, or designs a complex machine, they have meaningfully enhanced the society they live in.

Even those who simply ask questions can be considered wise and society can be considered better for them having been here. Merit cannot exist in a vacuum, it has to be that the individual's actions have some consequence for merit to exist.

## What about those who produce nothing?
Some people achieve far more success than it seems they rightly deserve. 

This is a key distinction that must be made. Merit is not equal to success. The society we live in is **not** a meritocracy (nor is any). It is important that we do not conflate the two. The fact there merit is not the only factor that goes into someone's success does not mean that the concept of merit itself is not objective. 

Precisely the reason you are likely asking this question is that you don't believe those people who have no merit deserve the success they have attained. This shows you that you have an intuitive idea of what merit is and that it is distinct from the outcomes an individual experiences.

## What is it to deserve success?
The key point to clarify here is how one defines the word "deserve". How is a supermodel *deserving* of fame and riches, simply for existing with a body fitting a particular set of dimensions?

We have an intuition of fairness that drives our judgment of what each person deserves. This does loosely align with a merit based approach. Those who provide the most benefit to society, deserve the highest rewards. But this intuitive merit function starts to break down when you leave the individual and small group setting.

Our moral intuitions evolved long before even the most basic societies existed, as described in the [framework](https://evidencebasedpolitics.org/README.html), we cannot trust these intuitions to design policy that maximises societal benefit as a whole.

We tend to value specific classes of profession far higher than more modern jobs that involve intangible knowledge work. It is no coincidence that these are the roles that humans would be carrying out for one another when our brains evolved.

- Reduce death (Doctors, Surgeons, Midwives)
- Heal illness & injury (Physicians, Nurses, Healers)
- Protect the group (Soldiers, Firefighters, Rescue Workers)
- Enforce fairness & order (Judges, Arbitrators, Elders)
- Transmit knowledge (Teachers, Professors, Mentors)
- Provide food security (Farmers, Fishers, Food Producers)
- Build durable infrastructure (Engineers, Architects, Master Craftspeople)
- Lead through responsibility (Competent Leaders, Commanders, Chiefs)
- Create shared meaning (Artists, Storytellers, Philosophers, Spiritual Leaders)

Many negative feelings stem from a collision between the complexity of all modern societies, and our moral intuitions.

## Scale and our moral intuitions
Imagine a man owns a company that manufactures widgets. He mostly works by hand producing around 100 widgets per day, and sells them for around £1 per widget.

This scenario very easy for us to hold in our minds, we can imagine carrying out 100 tasks in a day, we often do this in our own lives. It seems fair that he earns the money he earns for the work he did. He produced a hundred pounds of value and earned every pound of it.

Now imagine he is the owner of a company that produces 1 million widgets a day for the same price. This is where the moral intuition starts to fail, because we can't imagine someone working *hard* enough to deserve 1 million pounds a day.

This moral incongruence exists because our intuitions are not designed to handle scale of this magnitude. It's possible that society is so much better off because this man produces 1 million widgets per day that he *deserves* mathematically the payment he receives.

The nature of the man's work also compounds this effect, because previously his work involved physical action primarily. In the larger business it necessarily involves mostly knowledge work, work that is merely of words and decisions.

## How to resolve this moral incongruence?
Similar to the moral foundation described in the [framework](https://evidencebasedpolitics.org/README.html), when evaluating a person's merit, we must develop an objective mathematical function to calculate their total positive value to society.

In this sense we might be able to more objectively base our judgments about the business owner's value by what he produces.

Let's consider two scenarios.

**Drug king pin**
The widgets in the above scenario are packets of heroin. Heroin is well known to cause immense damage to humans. There is no argument that producing packets of heroin is a moral negative action.

By this logic we can calculate that his contribution to society is less than 0.

**Cancer researcher**
The widgets are now pills that cure cancer. The man discovered the cure for cancer and charges £1 per pill. Cancer causes immense damage to society, so we can attribute a positive moral value to each output e.g. +1. By this logic he produces 1 million units of societal improvement per day.

Both jobs are exactly the same. The man is carrying out exactly the same "work" to "earn" his one million pounds a day. Yet the second scenario is much more clearly positive.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>A person's merit should be determined by their net positive contribution to society.</p>
</div>

## What about human potential?
A concept that is often spoken of in schools, is the idea of "potential". Potential has a net-zero value to society. 

If we put the smartest man in the universe in an empty white room for his entire life, the man would produce exactly zero benefit to society. 

If the smartest man on earth was also born without empathy, and decided that the best course of action for himself was to live a life of crime, he would produce a net negative value to society.

The fact the man in both scenarios had more potential than any human on earth is completely irrelevant to the merit of the individual.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>A person's "potential" has no bearing on their contribution to society, and hence no bearing on their merit.</p>
</div>

# Meritocracy
In a human world, meritocracy can never exist. There are too many random elements that mean those with the most merit will necessarily not get the success they deserve due to effects outside societal control.

Think of
- Natural disasters
- Bad actors
- Natural human biases
- Bad luck

The world and humans are not compatible with a true meritocracy, however, we should not allow perfection to be the enemy of the good. 

Our goal is to maximise the positive outcomes for society, we will never reach the theoretical peak an omniscient being could achieve. With this in mind, we need to evaluate if meritocracy (or rather the pursuit of it) will actually produce the best outcomes in society.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>We can pursue meritocracy even knowing we will never achieve perfection.</p>
</div>

## Human coordination systems
A frequent mistake I see online is that people try to compare \[current societal system\] to an imaginary utopia, and pointing out all the places where the current system comes up short. This is a false comparison. Your options are not utopia or some other inferior system, your options are the available systems that can be implemented in any particular place.

Even among the societal systems we have, not all can just be plugged into a society at will. The humans within the group you are trying to organise must be compatible with the system. Think of the humans as the hardware, and the societal system as the software that runs on top of it.

### Capitalism

We can look at capitalism as an example of a societal system that has strict hardware requirements. Capitalism is the most effective system of reducing waste humanity has ever conceived of. But capitalism breaks down if the society does not have the infrastructure available to support it. 

Capitalism requires[^1]
- Rule of Law
- Protection of Property Rights
- A stable currency
- A government capable of enforcing the above

If a business owner can simply set fire to their competitors, capitalism cannot exist. If the government only allows one single business to produce televisions, the price of televisions can be set at whatever that business wants.

### Democracy

Democracy has a different set of operating system requirements.

- Freedom of speech
- Uncorrupted electoral processes
- Rule of law

If the currently elected leaders can simply give money in exchange for votes, democracy would readily devolve into authoritarianism. There are numerous other avenues that bad actors can corrupt the system and cause it to devolve into authoritarianism.

### Authoritarianism

Authoritarianism likewise needs the right hardware to run on.

- Centralized coercive power
- Information control
- Elite cohesion
- Suppression of rival power centers

If elites fracture, the system collapses into factional violence. If information escapes control, the populous may begin an uprising.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>Any societal coordination system requires a pre-existing set of infrastructure in order to prevent collapse.</p>
</div>

## Meritocracy

It's clear that meritocracy requires very specific human infrastructure to work effectively

- The ability to assess merit
- An environment that rewards merit
- Low corruption
- Cultural acceptance of unequal outcomes tied to performance

Meritocracy fails all the time due to human factors like prejudice, bias, and nepotism among others. Anything that adjusts the outcome using factors besides merit takes us further away from the most positive outcomes.

Given humans are born with involuntary biases and nepotism is almost entirely unavoidable, how can we ever have meritocracy? 

Just as with capitalism, to achieve the beneficial outcomes of the system, we must put systems in place to minimise these deleterious influences.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>Like all society management systems, meritocracy needs strict guard rails to remain effective.</p>
</div>

# Why would we want to adopt meritocracy?
Meritocracy, when perfectly implemented, is the fastest way to achieve the goals of any particular society. Importantly this does not state anything about the moral direction of the society. Purely that in whatever the direction society is headed, meritocracy will allow it get there faster. 

If the goal of a society is to destroy as many rival groups as possible, meritocracy will achieve the most destructive weapons, as quickly as possible. If the goal is to accumulate as much wealth by taking advantage of all others, meritocracy will extract wealth faster than any other system.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>Meritocracy does not infer any moral direction, merely the most efficient way to achieve an end goal.</p>
</div>

## Efficient use of scarce resources

The benefits of meritocracy can be more easily visualised with computers. You're dropped onto a planet with thousands of computers of various processing power. You have many problems to solve.

- What is the best way to create food?
- How can we prevent disease?
- How do we sustain our water supply?
- How can we best heal those who are injured?

Your job as coordinator of this society is to use the computers at your disposal to solve these problems. For each problem you have to choose which computers you use. There isn't enough power to run all of them at once, so you have to prioritise which computers you use to solve your problem.

These computers won't run forever either, they'll need maintenance, but again you are limited. There are only sufficient spare parts to keep some computers functioning.

Some computers are also capable of working really efficiently on specific problems. Agricultural computers can work on food supply problems. Medical computers are optimised to solve medical problems. 

All computers are technically able to work on any problems, but they are most efficient when used for their specialty.

Let's evaluate some management strategies we could use.

### Turn computers on at random
All computers get an equal chance to work on problems. Some computers get powered up and maintained, while others simply sit idle. The processing speed is irrelevant, the history is irrelevant.

Essentially the merit of the computer is irrelevant, everyone gets an equal chance at success. The main problem is that some inevitably have to stay turned off, because this world, like all worlds, has a finite amount of resources to go around. It is a zero-sum game, one computer being activated necessarily means another must be turned off.

### Take into account the history of the computers
Some of the computers on this planet were subject to substantial abuse. They were left unmaintained for a long time and were damaged when they fell off the back of a truck at one point. We could prioritise the wellbeing of these computers, because they are the most in need of maintenance.

### Apply arbitrary standards
Some of the computers were built with red cases, some with green. We could choose to activate all the red computers first, and then activate a few green computers with any remaining power.

### Use the most powerful computers first
Meritocracy would mean activating the fastest computers available first. You would leave those less powerful computers turned off. You would focus all your attention on the computers with the highest processing power available.

## Results
I have run a simulation to show how each of these strategies plays out.

![TotalProgressResults](total_progress.png)

We can see that the worst performing system is to use the history of the computer to allocate resources. This causes a disproportionate use of power and maintenance on a small subset of computers forever. Their history will never change, they will have always been damaged, and no amount of maintenance or runtime will ever change that. This takes resources away from the other computers forever leading to premature failure.

The most optimal strategy in pursuit of societal progress is meritocracy. We use the merit of the computer to determine runtime and maintenance allocation.

This would inevitably lead to many computers being left unpowered and unmaintained. This is the goal with meritocracy, the least productive receive no reward.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>Meritocracy is the most efficient way for a society to achieve its goals, whatever they may be.</p>
</div>

### Caviats
Humans are not computers
We can't just execute non productive people
People can increase in productivity over time
People are hard to predict

## Alignment with intuitive morality
The benefit of meritocracy is that it aligns fairly well with our intuitive moral judgments. We see it as fair that people are rewarded based on the value they bring. We see it as unfair when certain people are rewarded arbitrarily more for the same work.

# How would an equity based system work?
Generally the implementation of equity involves trying to offset the merit calculations to include several other non merit factors. The goal is to start from meritocracy, then modify the merit by some sort of disadvantage coefficient. The most comprehensive equity system you'll likely find right now in the world would consider all the following factors.

- Systemic discrimination
- Socioeconomic inequalities
- Historical exclusion or bias embedded in institutions
- Family income and wealth
- Neighborhood resources
- School quality
- Access to healthcare, nutrition, and stability
- Environmental constraints
- Exposure to violence
- Caregiving responsibilities
- Immigration or language barriers

Here is an example scenario on how we might do a merit analysis while attempting to use the history of the individual to compensate for historic inequality.

| Measurement                      | Person A | Person B |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Merit                            | 10       | 10       |
| Systemic discrimination exposure | 4        | 1        |
| Socioeconomic disadvantage       | 5        | 1        |
| Historical exclusion             | 4        | 1        |
| Family income & wealth           | 5        | 1        |
| Neighborhood resources           | 4        | 1        |
| School quality                   | 4        | 1        |
| Access to healthcare & nutrition | 3        | 1        |
| Environmental constraints        | 3        | 1        |
| Exposure to violence             | 3        | 1        |
| Caregiving responsibilities      | 2        | 1        |
| Immigration / language barriers  | 1        | 0        |

| Person   | Merit Score | Equity Burden Total | Equity Adjustment (÷10) | Final Adjusted Score |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Person A | 10          | 41                  | +4.1                    | **14.1**             |
| Person B | 10          | 11                  | +1.1                    | **11.1**             |

This type of analysis is used to override outcomes that would normally be based on merit alone. It also applies to situations where there is no natural priority system (similar to random allocation). This could be:

- Hiring and promotion decisions
- School and university admissions
- Scholarships, grants, and financial aid allocation
- Internship and apprenticeship selection
- Layoff and workforce reduction decisions
- Performance evaluations and advancement timelines
- Public housing placement and wait-list prioritization
- Healthcare triage and preventative care access
- Disability accommodations and workplace flexibility
- Childcare subsidies and family support programs
- Criminal justice decisions (diversion programs, sentencing alternatives)
- Parole, probation, and reentry support eligibility
- Allocation of social services and case-management resources
- Disaster relief and recovery assistance
- Small business loans, grants, and procurement access
- Government contracting and supplier diversity programs
- Zoning, infrastructure investment, and urban planning
- Access to legal aid and public defenders
- Immigration relief programs and integration services

## Necessary loss of efficiency
As we saw in the computer simulation, we are exchanging society level efficiency for a perceived sense of fairness. The questions that advocates of equity need to answer are:

- Is the loss of societal progress and efficiency worth the gain in fairness.
- By what metric do we judge fairness?
- Who determines what factors are included?
- Sweeping generalizations based on intrinsic attributes necessarily create unfairness
- How long until the disadvantage is compensated for?
- Could we compensate in other ways? Reparations?

# What problem are we trying to solve?
With an understanding of the meritocratic system, we can now see why we need to have some sort of controls in order to compensate for human failings in the implementation.

There are two classes of problems that we may want to correct for:

1. Human biases
2. Bad luck

## Human biases
Humans are riddled with biases, we are completely unable to think objectively about pretty much anything. A true meritocracy requires objective standards and objective measures of merit. Cheating the system by hiring an unqualified friend for a position in a business you work for reduces efficiency dramatically. Appointing people to positions of authority by excluding particular races or sexes reduces efficiency of the system.

### Effective controls

Controls must be implemented to prevent biases reducing the accuracy of the merit assessment. Here are some examples of controls that increase the likelihood that merit is used as the deciding factor.

- Blind hiring processes
- Standardized evaluation criteria and scoring rubrics
- Structured interviews with predetermined questions
- Independent review or audit of decisions
- Clear documentation and justification requirements for decisions
- Separation of decision-making authority (no single gatekeeper)
- Rotation of evaluators to prevent entrenched favoritism
- Use of objective performance metrics

An important consideration is that the administration of these controls detracts from the efficiency of the society, so a balancing calculation must be considered to assure that the cost of the controls does not exceed the productivity gained.

The above controls align fairly well with our moral intuitions. They are seen as fair because we intuitively believe people should be judged in a uniform way. 

These controls are generally uncontroversial because they are simply tools to help determine more accurately who is most deserving of success by trying to increase accuracy on their merit.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>Controls can be implemented to improve merit assessment accuracy.</p>
</div>

### Ineffective controls
Some controls that are commonly implemented that I will argue **do not** improve efficiency, they have either no effect, or simply skew results towards one group or another.

- Diverse hiring and promotion panels
- Bias-awareness and calibration training
- Equality monitoring (relative percentages of immutable characteristics)
- Guaranteed interview schemes
- Bias audits of hiring outcomes
- Gender pay gap reporting
- Mandatory diversity targets or quotas
- Post-hoc demographic reweighting of outcomes
- Veto power granted to non-evaluating stakeholders
- Appeals processes based solely on demographic disparity

#### 

## Bad luck

Bad luck can be used as a blanket term for any aspect of your life you had no conscious control over. This sounds like a reasonable definition, but it has serious flaws I will get into further on. Factors generally included in the bad luck category are:

- Race
- Sex
- Ethnicity
- Nationality or country of birth
- Family socioeconomic status at birth
- Parental education level
- Neighbourhood you grew up in
- Access to early childhood education
- Quality of primary and secondary schooling
- Health conditions present at birth
- Physical or cognitive disabilities
- Early-life trauma or instability

## Calculating the disadvantage coefficient
Let's assume for now that these were the only factors that could possibly disadvantage a person for simplicity. We need to determine if these could ever be implemented fairly.

### Race
To apply the race coefficient we have to determine the disadvantage for each particular race and then calculate the offset. Necessarily the race coefficient is the definition of racist stereotyping.

> A stereotype is a generalized belief about a particular category of people
> Wikipedia

Even when used for theoretically noble ends, stereotyping is stereotyping. The purpose for which you are stereotyping does not change any of the flawed reasoning around stereotyping.

If you want to know the problems with racist stereotyping, simply google it and you find a litany of problems. I will not re-iterate that here. I will simply discuss a few. 

#### Which races?
Generally these policies are often implemented by creating two categories:

- White
- Non-white

This is due to a political assumption that everyone non-white is equally disadvantaged by racism. This is simply not true.

 Not only are there specific non-white racial groups that are clearly not affected by racism to anywhere near the same level as other non-white groups.  \[CITATION]

Even groups with the same skin colour have wildly varying levels of success. \[CITATION]

### Individuals exist
The problem with generalising on simplistic categories like race and sex is that there is always larger individual variability in a group, than between groups. 

Put another way, there could be the most disadvantaged white man, born in the poorest most abusive environment. Compared with a black woman born into immense family wealth, never experiencing racism in her life.

Even if the group as a whole experienced one or more average disadvantages, the individual details are far more important when making individual decisions. This is precisely the reason it is considered harmful to use racist stereotypes to make decisions in life.

### How do we objectively calculate disadvantage?
If we assume that there are no individual experiences, we have to then calculate the biases for each specific group. We would generally turn to scientists and statisticians to figure it all out.

This is where things start to get messy. When we actually look at statistical analyses on race based outcomes it is far from a simple white vs non-white dichotomy.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231211001971?utm_source=chatgpt.com

>Pew Research Center: Black immigrants vs U.S.-born Black Americans (descriptive, high-quality)
> Reports higher median household income for Black immigrant-headed households than U.S.-born Black households (2019)

This is just one example that shows a theoretical blanket race based coefficient is simply inadequate.
We would need to have a race discrimination rank table to make a fair assessment.

| Group                                              | Coefficient |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------: |
| Black American (African American)                  |     **8.0** |
| Black Caribbean (e.g., Jamaican, Haitian)          |     **7.5** |
| Black African Immigrant (e.g., Nigerian, Ghanaian) |     **7.0** |
| Afro-Latino / Afro-Hispanic                        |     **7.0** |
| Native American / Alaska Native                    |     **6.5** |
| Hispanic / Latino (overall)                        |     **5.5** |
| Asian American (overall)                           |     **5.0** |
| Middle Eastern / North African (MENA)              |     **4.8** |
| White Hispanic                                     |     **3.5** |
| White (non-Hispanic)                               |     **2.0** |

### Country or area
Some areas have a racial split completely reversed to the majority in a particular country. In these areas the white individuals are the minority. If we apply a country level coefficient this will necessarily lead to traditional racist discrimination of white people. 

To those individual whites in the area their perception is that they are subject to system racial discrimination.

The question then becomes, how do we define: area. If a white man is in a town that is 90% black, with town level policies that disadvantage him, is that fair?

So now we see we need to incorporate geographic data into our coefficient map.

| Area (example)                                     | Level        |   White |   Black | Hispanic/Latino |   Asian |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------: | ------: | --------------: | ------: |
| United States (national baseline)                  | Country      |     2.0 |     8.0 |             5.5 |     5.0 |
| State X (overall)                                  | State        |     2.5 |     7.5 |             5.8 |     4.7 |
| Metro A (diverse, mixed power)                     | County/Metro |     3.0 |     6.5 |             5.5 |     5.2 |
| Town B (90% Black; local disadvantage for White)   | Municipality | **6.5** |     4.5 |             5.0 |     4.8 |
| Town C (80% White; exclusionary local effects)     | Municipality |     2.0 | **8.5** |         **7.0** |     5.5 |
| Neighborhood D (gentrifying; enforcement-driven)   | Census tract |     3.5 | **7.8** |         **7.2** |     5.6 |
| Neighborhood E (affluent enclave; access barriers) | Census tract |     2.0 | **8.0** |         **7.5** |     4.8 |
| Campus / Tech zone F (network-driven bias)         | District     |     2.8 |     5.8 |             5.0 | **6.2** |

### What is discrimination?
Now the task is becoming more and more complex, we still have the problem of being able to measure any particular individual's rate of discrimination.

Scientists use several techniques to try to determine levels of discrimination. One such technique is to simply ask the individual if they think they have experienced racial discrimination.

These polls are then often used to claim bold conclusions about the rates of discrimination across a particular country. 

The fundamental problem is that it has been shown that those who are told they can expect to be discriminated against, perceive discrimination where there is none. \[CITATON TO STUDY]

There are outcome based statistical analyses that are used to determine if discrimination exists, but these are often done in aggregate at country level, and don't take into account sub-cultural effects that might influence results. If one culture values education more than another, is it fair to claim that outcome differences are due to racism?

### Intersectionality

Intersectionality is the idea that many different disadvantaging characteristics come together to dramatically increase a person's overall disadvantage coefficient. This could be itself with an adjustment factor. For example, it may be that being a woman & black leads to a higher coefficient than the individual disadvantages of being a woman or black.

| Characteristic          | Coefficient |
| ----------------------- | ----------: |
| Neither woman nor Black |         2.0 |
| Woman only              |         4.0 |
| Black only              |         8.0 |
| **Woman & Black**       |    **10.0** |

### Comparative disadvantage
On top of intersectionality, we now need to compare oranges to apples. How disadvantaging is being disabled to being of a minority race? If I am missing an arm, is that equivalent to being black in a majority white country? What about two arms? Who decides this?

What objective data could we use to make this determination?

At some point we start to enter the disadvantage olympics.

## The magnitude of the problem
The gargantuan task is beginning to unfold. This was an exploration of 3 factors, sex, race, disability. I hope that it is clear by now that we can never hope to generate sufficiently complex or accurate enough coefficient tables to come anywhere close to being fair. Let alone the fact that the majority of these systems are applied without any consideration to the local demographics involved.

This generally leads to systemic discrimination of large swathes of people. This is both unfair and detrimental to the societal efficiency. We will compound our efficiency losses, while at the same time reducing the overall fairness.

## Perverse incentives
An interesting phenomenon begins to occur once you begin applying disadvantage coefficients. Everyone suddenly starts getting a lot more disadvantaged.

This is known as a perverse incentive.

# Other forms of bad luck
In addition to the above commonly used classifications, there are many serious detriments to success that don't factor in to anyone's idea of equity. The primary criteria for choosing the disadvantage characteristics is mostly political. 

Assuming for now, we could achieve a 100% fair coefficient map, that takes into consideration intersectionality. We have to still come to an agreement about what factors actually go into the map.

So if we were to design a fair coefficient map what else might we include?
