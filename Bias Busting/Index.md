# Bias
Human brains are full of [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). There are hundreds of cognitive biases. These are shortcuts in thinking, that have evolved in the mind to reduce the likelihood that someone will die before passing on their genes in a hunter-gatherer world.

While they no doubt represent some local optima for living in that environment, they are wholly unsuitable for making political choices in our current, extremely complex environment.

# Primary biases
I will focus on some important biases here, but many more play a role in decision-making regarding politics.
