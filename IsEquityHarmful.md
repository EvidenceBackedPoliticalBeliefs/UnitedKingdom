# Is Equity Harmful to Society?
Equity is a term often conflated with equality, but importantly distinct. Equity has been interpreted to mean equality of outcomes over equality of opportunities. This is a somewhat reasonable sounding premise, but the core concept, and implementation leads much to be desired. As I hope to show in this article.

As always please read the [Bias Busting](https://evidencebasedpolitics.org/FlawedThinking/BiasBusting.html) guide if you have not already done so.

# Definitions
It will be beneficial to explicitly define what I am referring to in the arguments.

## Harm
<a href="Argumentation.md#-implicit-assumptions" class="tag tag-implicit"></a>

Harm is defined according to the [framework](https://evidencebasedpolitics.org/README.html) (harm based consequentialism).

## Merit

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

An individual's total value to society in the form of their skills, achievements, effort, labour. 

No characteristic of their involuntary identity is considered in merit (e.g. race, sex, etc). 

No knowledge of their personal history is required beyond their past achievements and labours (no disabilities, no past discrimination etc).

## Equality

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/argumentation-tags.css">

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

For this argument I will take this general definition of equality taken from [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/equality-human-rights)

> Generally, an ideal of uniformity in treatment or status by those in a position to affect either.

The end goal of equality would be equal opportunity for all. Essentially no biases to involuntary or immutable states would affect someone's life. That may include Race, Sex, Sexuality, Appearance, Height, Weight, Age.

Allowing a person's merit and ability be the sole determinant of their success.

Defined as a function `Deserved success = Merit`.

## Equity

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

I will define equity by the top definition returned by [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=equity) (Oxford Languages)

> The quality of being fair and just, especially in a way that takes account of and seeks to address existing inequalities.

Equity is the pursuit of balancing outcomes by taking into consideration a person's personal circumstances and history and adjusting outcomes accordingly.

Defined as a function `Deserved success = Merit + Disadvantages coefficient`

## Equality vs Equity

<a href="Argumentation.md#-descriptive" class="tag tag-descriptive"></a>

The difference between equity and equality is often presented with the simplistic example of a ladder. 

- There are 3 people
- Two of the people are of an average height
- One is 50% shorter than average due to a genetic defect.

| Height | Equality | Equity |
|-|-|-|
| 🧍Average| 🪜 | 🪜|
| 🧍🏽Average | 🪜 | 🪜|
| 🧍 Short | 🪜| 🪜🪜|

Equality states that everyone is treated fairly and equally by being issued the same ladder.

Equity states that the outcome is unfair because the shorter person was disadvantaged at birth. The shorter person is given a longer (more expensive) ladder to balance the outcomes.

## Implicit arguments
Equity has several implicit premises.

1. Equal outcomes are more morally positive than unequal outcomes
2. Equal outcomes will improve society as a whole.
3. Merit is not a valid metric in society without considering individual disadvantages

# Argument
I will argue:

- The pursuit of equity is harmful to society
- Equity policies can never be moral, even on an individual basis

# Is merit objective?
Merit consists of the outputs of a human being's existence. If a person makes a great piece of art, or designs a complex machine, they have meaningfully enhanced the society they live in.

Even those who simply ask questions can be considered wise and society can be considered better for them having been here. Merit cannot exist in a vacuum, it has to be that the individual's actions have some consequence for merit to exist.

## What about those who produce nothing?
Some people achieve far more success than it seems they rightly deserve. 

This is a key distinction that must be made. Merit is not equal to success. The society we live in is **not** a meritocracy (nor is any). It is important that we do not conflate the two. The fact their merit is not the only factor that goes into their success does not mean that the concept of merit itself is not objective. 

Precisely the reason you are likely asking this question is that you don't believe those people deserve the success they have attained relative to their merit. This shows you that you have an intuitive idea of what merit is and that it is distinct from the outcomes an individual experiences.

## What is it to deserve success?
The key point to clarify here is how one defines the word "deserve". How is a supermodel *deserving* of fame and riches, simply for existing with a body fitting a particular set of dimensions?

We have an intuition of fairness that drives our judgment of what each person deserves. This does loosely align with a merit based approach. Those who provide the most benefit to society, deserve the highest rewards. But this intuitive merit function starts to break down when you leave the individual and small group setting.

Our moral intuitions evolved long before even the most basic societies existed, as described in the [framework](https://evidencebasedpolitics.org/README.html), we cannot trust these intuitions to design policy that maximises societal benefit as a whole.

We tend to value specific classes of profession far higher than more modern jobs that involve intangible knowledge work. It is no coincidence that these are the roles that humans would be carrying out for one another when our brains evolved.

- Reduce death (Doctors, Surgeons, Midwives)
- Heal illness & injury (Physicians, Nurses, Healers)
- Protect the group (Soldiers, Firefighters, Rescue Workers)
- Enforce fairness & order (Judges, Arbitrators, Elders)
- Transmit knowledge (Teachers, Professors, Mentors)
- Provide food security (Farmers, Fishers, Food Producers)
- Build durable infrastructure (Engineers, Architects, Master Craftspeople)
- Lead through responsibility (Competent Leaders, Commanders, Chiefs)
- Create shared meaning (Artists, Storytellers, Philosophers, Spiritual Leaders)

Many negative feelings stem from a collision between the complexity of all modern societies, and our moral intuitions.

## Scale and our moral intuitions
Imagine a man owns a company that manufactures widgets. He mostly works by hand producing around 100 widgets per day, and sells them for around £1 per widget.

This scenario very easy for us to hold in our minds, we can imagine carrying out 100 tasks in a day, we often do this in our own lives. It seems fair that he earns the money he earns for the work he did. He produced a hundred pounds of value and earned every pound of it.

Now imagine he is the owner of a company that produces 1 million widgets a day for the same price. This is where the moral intuition starts to fail, because we can't imagine someone working *hard* enough to deserve 1 million pounds a day.

This moral incongruence exists because our intuitions are not designed to handle scale of this magnitude. It's possible that society is so much better off because this man produces 1 million widgets per day that he *deserves* mathematically the payment he receives.

The nature of the man's work also compounds this effect, because previously his work involved physical action primarily. In the larger business it necessarily involves mostly knowledge work, work that is merely of words and decisions.

## How to resolve this moral incongruence?
Similar to the moral foundation described in the [framework](https://evidencebasedpolitics.org/README.html), when evaluating a person's merit, we must develop an objective mathematical function to calculate their total positive value to society.

In this sense we might be able to more objectively base our judgments about the business owner's value by what he produces.

Let's consider two scenarios.

**Drug king pin**
The widgets in the above scenario are packets of heroin. Heroin is well known to cause immense damage to humans. There is no argument that producing packets of heroin is a not morally negative action.

By this logic we can calculate that his contribution to society is less than 0.

**Cancer researcher**
The widgets are now pills that cure cancer. The man discovered the cure for cancer and charges £1 per pill. Cancer causes immense damage to society, so we can attribute a positive moral value to each output e.g. +1. By this logic he produces 1 million units of societal improvement per day.

Both jobs are exactly the same. The man is carrying out exactly the same "work" to "earn" his one million pounds a day. Yet the second scenario is much more clearly positive.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>A person's merit should be determined by their net positive contribution to society.</p>
</div>

## What about human potential?
A concept that is often spoken of in schools, is the idea of "potential". Potential has a net-zero value to society. 

If we put the smartest man in the universe in an empty white room for his entire life, the man would produce exactly zero benefit to society. 

If the smartest man on earth was also born without empathy, and decided that the best course of action for himself was to live a life of crime, he would produce a net negative value to society.

The fact the man in both scenarios had more potential than any human on earth is completely irrelevant to the merit of the individual.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>A person's "potential" has no bearing on their contribution to society, and hence no bearing on their merit.</p>
</div>

# Meritocracy
In a human world, meritocracy can never exist. There are too many random elements that mean those with the most merit will necessarily not get the success they deserve due to effects outside societal control.

Think of

- Bad actors
- Natural human biases
- Bad luck

The world and humans are not compatible with a true meritocracy, however, we should not allow perfection to be the enemy of the good. 
Our goal (according to the framework) is to maximise the positive outcomes for society, we will never reach the theoretical peak an omniscient being could achieve. With this in mind, we need to evaluate if meritocracy (or rather the pursuit of it) will actually produce the best outcomes in society.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>We can pursue meritocracy even knowing we will never achieve perfection.</p>
</div>

## Human coordination systems
A frequent mistake I see online is that people try to compare \[current societal system\] to an imaginary utopia, and pointing out all the places where the current system comes up short. This is a false comparison. Your options are not utopia or some other inferior system. Your options are the available systems that can be implemented in any particular place.

Even among the societal systems we know of, not all can just be plugged into a society at will. The humans within the group you are trying to organise must be compatible with the system. Think of the humans as the hardware, and the societal system as the software that runs on top of it.

### Capitalism

We can look at capitalism as an example of a societal system that has strict hardware requirements. Capitalism is the most effective system of reducing waste humanity has ever conceived of. But capitalism breaks down if the society does not have the infrastructure available to support it. 

Capitalism requires[^1]
- Rule of Law
- Protection of Property Rights
- A stable currency
- A government capable of enforcing the above

If a business owner can simply set fire to their competitors, capitalism cannot exist. If the government only allows one single business to produce televisions, the price of televisions can be set at whatever that business wants. This is a monopoly which is must be prevented for capitalism to work.

### Democracy

Democracy has a different set of operating system requirements.

- Freedom of speech
- Uncorrupted electoral processes
- Rule of law

If the currently elected leaders can simply give money in exchange for votes, democracy would readily devolve into authoritarianism. There are numerous other avenues that bad actors can corrupt the system and cause it to devolve into authoritarianism.

### Authoritarianism

Authoritarianism likewise needs the right hardware to run on.

- Centralized coercive power
- Information control
- Elite cohesion
- Suppression of rival power centers

If elites fracture, the system collapses into factional violence. If information escapes control, the populous may begin an uprising.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>Any societal coordination system requires a pre-existing set of infrastructure in order to prevent collapse.</p>
</div>

## Meritocracy

It's clear that meritocracy requires very specific human infrastructure to work effectively

- The ability to assess merit
- An environment that rewards merit
- Low corruption
- Cultural acceptance of unequal outcomes tied to performance

Meritocracy fails all the time due to human factors like prejudice, bias, and nepotism among others. Anything that adjusts the outcome using factors besides merit takes us further away from the most positive outcomes.

Given humans are born with involuntary biases and nepotism is almost entirely unavoidable, how can we ever have meritocracy? 

Just as with capitalism, to achieve the beneficial outcomes of the system, we must put safeguards in place to minimise these deleterious influences.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>Like all society management systems, meritocracy needs strict guard rails to remain effective.</p>
</div>

# Why would we want to adopt meritocracy?
Meritocracy, when perfectly implemented, is the fastest way to achieve the goals of any particular society. Importantly this does not state anything about the moral direction of the society. Purely that in whatever the direction society is headed, meritocracy will allow it get there faster. 

If the goal of a society is to destroy as many rival groups as possible, meritocracy will achieve the most destructive weapons, as quickly as possible. If the goal is to accumulate as much wealth by taking advantage of all others, meritocracy will extract wealth faster than any other system.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>Meritocracy does not infer any moral direction, merely an efficient way to achieve an end goal.</p>
</div>

## Efficient use of scarce resources

The benefits of meritocracy can be more easily visualised with computers. You're dropped onto a planet with thousands of computers of various processing power. You have many problems to solve.

- What is the best way to create food?
- How can we prevent disease?
- How do we sustain our water supply?
- How can we best heal those who are injured?

Your job as coordinator of this society is to use the computers at your disposal to solve these problems. For each problem you have to choose which computers you use. There isn't enough power to run all of them at once, so you have to prioritise which computers you use to solve your problem.

These computers won't run forever either, they'll need maintenance, but again you are limited. There are only sufficient spare parts to keep some computers functioning.

Some computers are also capable of working really efficiently on specific problems. Agricultural computers can work on food supply problems. Medical computers are optimised to solve medical problems. 

All computers are technically able to work on any problems, but they are most efficient when used for their specialty.

Let's evaluate some management strategies we could use.

### Turn computers on at random
All computers get an equal chance to work on problems. Some computers get powered up and maintained, while others simply sit idle. The processing speed is irrelevant, the history is irrelevant.

Essentially the merit of the computer is irrelevant, everyone gets an equal chance at success. The main problem is that some inevitably have to stay turned off, because this world, like all worlds, has a finite amount of resources to go around. It is a zero-sum game, one computer being activated necessarily means another must be turned off.

### Take into account the history of the computers
Some of the computers on this planet were subject to substantial abuse. They were left unmaintained for a long time and were damaged when they fell off the back of a truck at one point. We could prioritise the wellbeing of these computers, because they are the most in need of maintenance.

### Apply arbitrary standards
Some of the computers were built with red cases, some with green. We could choose to activate all the red computers first, and then activate a few green computers with any remaining power.

### Use the most powerful computers first
Meritocracy would mean activating the fastest computers available first. You would leave those less powerful computers turned off. You would focus all your attention on the computers with the highest processing power available.

## Results
I have run a simulation to show how each of these strategies plays out.

![TotalProgressResults](total_progress.png)

We can see that the worst performing system is to use the history of the computer to allocate resources. This causes a disproportionate use of power and maintenance on a small subset of computers forever. Their history will never change, they will have always been damaged, and no amount of maintenance or runtime will ever change that. This takes resources away from the other computers forever leading to premature failure.

The most optimal strategy in pursuit of societal progress is meritocracy. We use the merit of the computer to determine runtime and maintenance allocation.

This would inevitably lead to many computers being left unpowered and unmaintained. This is the goal with meritocracy, the least productive receive no reward.

<div class="important-premise">
<p>Meritocracy is the most efficient way for a society to achieve its goals, whatever they may be.</p>
</div>

### Caviats
Humans are not computers
We can't just execute non productive people
People can increase in productivity over time
People are hard to predict

## Alignment with intuitive morality
The benefit of meritocracy is that it aligns fairly well with our intuitive moral judgments. We see it as fair that people are rewarded based on the value they bring. We see it as unfair when certain people are rewarded arbitrarily more for the same work.

# How would an equity based system work?
Generally the implementation of equity involves trying to offset the merit calculations to include several other non merit factors.

- Systemic discrimination
- Socioeconomic inequalities
- Historical exclusion or bias embedded in institutions
- Family income and wealth
- Neighborhood resources
- School quality
- Access to healthcare, nutrition, and stability
- Environmental constraints
- Exposure to violence
- Caregiving responsibilities
- Immigration or language barriers

Here is an example scenario on how we might do a merit analysis while attempting to use the history of the individual to compensate for historic inequality.

| Measurement                      | Person A | Person B |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Merit                            | 10       | 10       |
| Systemic discrimination exposure | 4        | 1        |
| Socioeconomic disadvantage       | 5        | 1        |
| Historical exclusion             | 4        | 1        |
| Family income & wealth           | 5        | 1        |
| Neighborhood resources           | 4        | 1        |
| School quality                   | 4        | 1        |
| Access to healthcare & nutrition | 3        | 1        |
| Environmental constraints        | 3        | 1        |
| Exposure to violence             | 3        | 1        |
| Caregiving responsibilities      | 2        | 1        |
| Immigration / language barriers  | 1        | 0        |

| Person   | Merit Score | Equity Burden Total | Equity Adjustment (÷10) | Final Adjusted Score |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Person A | 10          | 41                  | +4.1                    | **14.1**             |
| Person B | 10          | 11                  | +1.1                    | **11.1**             |

This type of analysis is used to override outcomes that would normally be based on merit alone. It also applies to situations where there is no natural priority system (similar to random allocation). This could be:

- Hiring and promotion decisions
- School and university admissions
- Scholarships, grants, and financial aid allocation
- Internship and apprenticeship selection
- Layoff and workforce reduction decisions
- Performance evaluations and advancement timelines
- Public housing placement and wait-list prioritization
- Healthcare triage and preventative care access
- Disability accommodations and workplace flexibility
- Childcare subsidies and family support programs
- Criminal justice decisions (diversion programs, sentencing alternatives)
- Parole, probation, and reentry support eligibility
- Allocation of social services and case-management resources
- Disaster relief and recovery assistance
- Small business loans, grants, and procurement access
- Government contracting and supplier diversity programs
- Zoning, infrastructure investment, and urban planning
- Access to legal aid and public defenders
- Immigration relief programs and integration services



## Harms those who would benefit through lost trust
## Democracy makes this even worse
